# Reverse_Shell_detector
This is a project that is meant to supplement Windows Defender in order to detect and block reverse shells
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

This repo contains sample code of a reverse shell. YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THIS FOR ILLIGAL PURPOSES.

The point of providing a reverse shell demo is intending to provide you with a safe way to test this rev shell detector. Otherwise you'd either have to write your own or get some sketchy version somewhere else. 

WELCOME TO THE REVERSE SHELL DETECTOR

The intention of this project is to provide an executable that detects if a reverse shell is opened on a Windows client or server. Windows Defender does not do a good job of detecting reverse shells, so this is meant to supplement it. 

The project will be written in python for the sake of my stupid brain being able to write it.
